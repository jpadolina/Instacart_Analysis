# Instacart_Analysis
This repo contains a data science project I did with a group of classmates to analyze Instacart consumer behavior. The objective was to get more hands-on experience with techniques including K-means clustering, Principal Components Analysis, and market basket analysis. I was specifically focused on the K-means clustering aspect of the analysis, which was compared against PCA. This project was inspired by the dataset found in an Instacart Kaggle competition done a few years earlier.
